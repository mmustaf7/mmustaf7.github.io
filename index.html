  <h1>DNS: The Backbone of Human-Friendly Internet Navigation</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The World Wide Web allows people all over the world to access information using brief, simple-to-recollect web addresses like www.wikipedia.org. Behind the scenes, though, these names have to be translated into numerical IP addresses so that the computers can locate and communicate with one another. The Domain Name System (DNS) does just this. DNS is the Internet phone book, which translates simple, easy-to-recollect domain names to IP addresses. Otherwise, humans would need to recall complex sequences of numbers instead of simple names. This essay examines DNS's structure, function, history, vulnerabilities, and future in an effort to illustrate how it unobtrusively underpins nearly every aspect of contemporary web utilization.</p>

  <h2>What is DNS?</h2>
  <p>DNS stands for Domain Name System, and it is a decentralized and distributed naming system used on the Internet. Its main purpose is to translate human-readable domain names—like <em>www.amazon.com</em>—into IP addresses such as 192.0.2.44 that computers and routers must utilize in order to locate and retrieve websites. DNS enables us to utilize simple-to-remember domain names as opposed to difficult-to-remember IP strings, for an open and accessible web culture. This underlying framework works automatically every time one enters a web address in a browser, downloads software, or sends mail.</p>
