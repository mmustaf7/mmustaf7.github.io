  <h1>How DNS Works</h1>

  <h2>History of DNS</h2>
  <p>Before DNS, hostnames were converted into IP addresses by ARPANET computers using a single centralized file called HOSTS.TXT. As host numbers grew in the early 1980s, the practice was discovered to be unscalable. DNS was deployed by Paul Mockapetris in 1983 to address the problem and designed a distributed system for dynamic resolution of domain names (Mockapetris, 1983). DNS enabled hierarchical naming and distributed control that made it possible for the Internet to expand exponentially. DNS was standardized in earlier RFCs like RFC 882 and RFC 883, and it has been the foundation for the scalable Internet address system that is in use on the Internet today.</p>

  <h2>DNS Structure and Hierarchy</h2>
  <p>DNS is hierarchical. At the root is the root domain, denoted by a dot (.), then Top-Level Domains (TLDs) such as .com, .org, and country codes such as .uk. Then beneath the TLDs are second-level domains (e.g., example in example.com), then subdomains (e.g., mail.example.com). This enables distributed control and simplicity of scalability. It is governed by ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) and IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) who oversee the root zone and delegate control to registrars and domain owners (ICANN, n.d.; IANA, n.d.).</p>

  <h2>DNS Records</h2>
  <p>DNS records are placed in various kinds of records, each serving a specific purpose. An A record points a domain to an IPv4 address, and there are AAAA records for IPv6 addresses. CNAME records alias one domain as another domain, and MX records specify mail servers for receiving email. NS records specify which servers are authoritative for a domain. TXT records are used for human-readable data as well as some of the significant technical purposes such as SPF, DKIM, and site verification. All these types of records help DNS to direct and organize Internet traffic securely and efficiently.</p>
