            <h2>DNS Records</h2>
            <p>
                DNS uses A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, NS, TXT records to route traffic and verify
                identities. Each has a specific function in resolving names and
                providing services.

            <h2>Security Threats and Countermeasures</h2>
            <p>
                DNS was not designed with security in mind. Threats include DNS
                spoofing and cache poisoning. DNSSEC, DoH, and DoT help secure DNS
                queries through encryption and digital signatures.

            <h2>Real-World Applications</h2>
            <p>
                Major providers like Google, Cloudflare, and Cisco offer DNS services
                with speed, privacy, and filtering. Organizations rely on internal DNS
                to manage access and performance.

            <h2>Future Directions</h2>
            <p>
                DNS is evolving with encrypted protocols, blockchain-based systems like
                Namecoin and ENS, and AI for management. These innovations aim for more
                secure, decentralized DNS.
